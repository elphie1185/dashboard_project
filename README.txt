Title: Shinydashboard Project - Website Performance

The aim of the project was for the client to better understand how the website’ users were navigating the site, with a focus on driving visitors to sign up for events. The website sees roughly 9000 visitors per month. However, only a small number of these visitors - about 100 per month - use the website book an event.
The dashboard focused on answering the following question:
- What is the geographical location of visitors?
- How many events booking are made and where are they made from geographically?
- What are the pages where users drop off the most frequently?
- How do visitors arrive on the site?
- What type of device visitors are using to access the site?
