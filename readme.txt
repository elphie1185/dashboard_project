The aim of the project was to design a dashboard in R shiny to better understand the client’s website performance and usage with a focus on certain goal completion. 

The website roughly sees a large number of visitors per month but only 1.1% use the website for a booking. The aim of the dashboard is to show the goal completion over a set period of time and have insight on the means used when visiting the website. This includes: 
- The type of devices used to visit the website when making a booking
- Where the website was access from to do make a booking
- Geographic location of people making a booking

Option on the display of the goal completion was generated monthly, weekly and daily in order to narrow any spike in the number of bookings to a specific day. 


The dashboard also shows the regional performances of the website. Including geographic location of the persons making a booking and overall geographic location of people visiting the website.


The data was extracted using the Google Analytics account. 

For the purpose of generating synthetic data, the date selection was limited to 1st January 2019 to the 8th of September 2019.
