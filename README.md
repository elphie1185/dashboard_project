# dashboard_project

## Project_scope

The client would like to better understand how their website users were navigating the site, with a focus on driving visitors 
to sign up for events. The website sees roughly 9000 visitors per month. However, only a small number of these visitors - 
about 100 per month - use the website book an event.

To illustrate this the dashboard answers the following questions (for a selected date range): 
  - How many events booking were completed?
  - Where were these events booking made from (geographically)?
  - From what type of device?
  - How do user lnd on the website?
  - On which page do they land, and which page do they exit?
  - Where are visitors from?
